<h1 style="font size:50px; text-align:center;">About</h1>
<p style="font size:20px; text-align:center; line height: 30px: margin-bottom:50px;">Flipkart was founded in October 2007 in Bangalore[11] by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, alumni of the IIT, Delhi and former Amazon employees.[12][13][14] The company was started from a two-bedroom apartment in Kormangala, Bengaluru. The initial investment was provided by their families, which was INR 2 Lakh from each family. The website was kicked off in October 2007 and the company was only limited to selling books at that time country-wide shipping.[15] Flipkart slowly grew in prominence and was receiving 100 orders per day by 2008.</p>
